1. What is HTML? What does it do? 
HTML is a markup language which is a set of rules that defines how the layout and presentation of text and images should appear in a digital document. It allows structuring documents, adding formatting, and specifying how different elements should be displayed (or “rendered”) on webpages.
2. What is CSS? What does it do? 
CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets and it lets us style our pages to make them more appealing and increase usability.We use it to create rules that specify how content should appear.

3. Access https://www.fordham.edu/. In your own words, describe how this webpage uses structure to convey meaning and navigation options to the user. 

The school’s name is in big red text in front of a white banner on the left side of the site which brings attention to it. This is to make it obvious what site people are on
When you move your cursor towards the images advertising articles, the title becomes 
underlined showing you that it is a link you can click and navigate to
Articles that the school wants you to look at more and think you will find most interesting is shown bigger with bigger text to encourage users to navigate towards it 
Smaller articles are shown in smaller boxes and smaller headings 
The toggle and tab options are in small text and separated by brackets so users know that they are links to different spaces on the site
Each section on the website is divided by border and background color to show a switch in information or space

If two rule are of same complexity than the rule that came later will take priority
If you tag a rule as important than it will take priority and is used as a method to ignore hierarchy
