In class assignment 3 
1. In certain programming languages the source code is not directly translated by the target machine. Instead, a different program, aka the interpreter, reads and executes the code, this is called an ___interpreted_____ language. 
2. Type checking is performed at runtime, means that the type of a variable is allowed to change over its lifetime, this is called __dynamic____ typing. 
3. JS for web browser work doesn’t tend to use classes to make objects, and is written in a more ___functional_____ style. 
4. Variables that are block scoped, not declarable use the keyword ____const____
 5. ____scope____ determines the accessibility (visibility) of variables. 
6. Variables assigned with the ____const____ keyword are block scoped and not re-declarable. 
7. Functions that can be passed as an argument to another function and called later are called __callback functions______. 
8. Non-primitive data types are (almost)all technically ___objects____ in memory.
      9. Make an html page called in-class-4.html and a file called in-class-4.js:-

  	 a. in the html file add html and header elements, and add a script tag that references in-class-4.js relatively via its src attribute -
b. in in-class-4.js put: 
i. a console.log(“in-class-4.js loaded!”); -
c. now add a second script tag in the html file and: -
i. create a const variable called firstObject and assign to it an object created via a literal constructor with a property called name and another property called echo. For the value of name put your first namd and for the value of -echo add a function to console.log your name(remember to use the this 
keyword to access the name property of the object) and call the echo 
method of the firstName object -
ii. after the echo call from the previous question, update the value of the name to your last name and call echo again, you should have -
“in-class-4.js loaded!”, “your first name”, “Your last name” as output -
10. In the in-class-4.js file: 
a. Make an array with the elements 1,2,3,4,5. Create a for loop and in the code block: =
i. If the index is odd console log a string with the index number and if it is odd or even, an example: “1 is odd!”, “2 is even!”. Use If statements and 
template literals for this.
